## Local credentials (do not commit)

Put your GCP service account key here locally:

- config/keys/service-account.json

This folder is ignored by git to prevent leaking credentials.

Example (Codespaces):
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/workspaces/cloud-data-warehouse-retail/config/keys/service-account.json"
